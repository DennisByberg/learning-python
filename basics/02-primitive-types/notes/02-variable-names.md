# Variable Names

## Best Practices

```python
# Good - descriptive names
student_count = 1000
course_rating = 4.99
is_active = True

# Bad - unclear names
x = 1000
r = 4.99
a = True
```

## Naming Conventions

```python
# Good - lowercase with underscores
first_name = "Alice"
total_price = 99.99

# Avoid - other styles
FirstName = "Alice"
TOTAL_PRICE = 99.99
```

## Code Style

```python
# Good - spaces around =
name = "Python"
age = 25

# Bad - no spaces
name="Python"
age=25
```

## Key Points

- **Descriptive names** make code self-documenting
- **snake_case** (lowercase with underscores) is Python convention
- **Spaces around =** improves readability
