# Variables

## What are Variables?

Variables **store data in computer memory**.

```python
students_count = 1000
rating = 4.99
is_published = False
course_name = "Python Programming"
```

## Python is Case Sensitive

```python
name = "John"
Name = "Jane"
NAME = "Bob"
# These are three DIFFERENT variables!
```

## Variable Naming Rules

**Valid:**

```python
age = 25
first_name = "Alice"
_private_var = "hidden"
course2024 = "Python"
```

**Invalid:**

```python
2students = 100      # Cannot start with number
first-name = "Bob"   # Hyphens not allowed
class = "Math"       # 'class' is a reserved keyword
```

## Naming Convention

Use **snake_case** in Python:

```python
# Good
student_count = 1000
course_name = "Python"

# Avoid
studentCount = 1000
courseName = "Python"
```

## Key Points

- Variables store data in computer memory
- **Python is case sensitive** - `name` ≠ `Name`
- Use **snake_case** naming convention
- Variables can be reassigned
