# Your First Python Program

## Creating a Python File

To write Python programs, you create files with the `.py` extension. This allows you to save your code and run it multiple times.

## Basic Print Statements

The `print()` function is used to display output to the screen:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

This outputs: `Hello World!`

## String Multiplication

In Python, you can multiply strings to repeat them:

```python
print('*' * 10)
```

This outputs: `**********`

The `*` operator repeats the string `'*'` ten times.

## Running Your Program

To run a Python file from the exercises folder:

```bash
python 01-getting-started/exercises/app.py
# or
python3 01-getting-started/exercises/app.py
```

## Complete Example

```python
print('Hello World!')
print('*' * 10)
```

Output:

```
Hello World!
**********
```

## File Organization

Keep your Python exercises organized in folders:

- Create an `exercises/` folder for your practice programs
- Use descriptive filenames (you can rename `app.py` to something like `hello_world.py`)

## Key Points

- Python files use the `.py` extension
- `print()` function displays output
- Strings can be multiplied with `*` to repeat them
- Each `print()` statement creates a new line
- Run Python files from the terminal using `python path/to/filename.py`
- Organize your code in folders for better project structure
