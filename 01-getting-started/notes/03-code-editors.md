# Code Editors and IDEs

## What are Code Editors and IDEs?

**Code Editors** are text editors specifically designed for writing code. They typically include syntax highlighting and basic code formatting.

**IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** are more comprehensive tools that include:

- **Autocompletion** - Suggests code as you type
- **Debugging** - Tools to find and fix errors in your code
- **Testing** - Built-in support for running and managing tests
- **Project management** - File organization and navigation
- **Version control** - Git integration

## Popular Options

While there are many editors available for Python development, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is considered one of the best choices because:

- Excellent Python extension with rich features
- Great autocompletion and IntelliSense
- Powerful debugging capabilities
- Integrated terminal
- Extensive extension ecosystem
- Free and open source
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## VS Code for Python

To get the best Python experience in VS Code:

1. Install the Python extension
2. Select your Python interpreter (we use Python 3.13.6)
3. Enable features like:
   - Linting (code quality checks)
   - Formatting (automatic code styling)
   - IntelliSense (smart autocompletion)

## Why IDEs Matter

IDEs make Python development much more efficient by:

- Catching errors before you run the code
- Suggesting corrections and improvements
- Providing quick access to documentation
- Making debugging easier with
