# Variable Names

## Best Practices for Naming Variables

### Use Descriptive Names

Variables should clearly describe what data they store:

```python
# Good - descriptive names
student_count = 1000
course_rating = 4.99
user_email = "john@example.com"

# Bad - unclear names
x = 1000
r = 4.99
e = "john@example.com"
```

### Use Lowercase Letters

Python convention is to use lowercase letters with underscores:

```python
# Good
first_name = "Alice"
total_price = 99.99
is_active = True

# Avoid
FirstName = "Alice"
TOTAL_PRICE = 99.99
IsActive = True
```

### Use Spaces Around "="

Always put spaces around the assignment operator for better readability:

```python
# Good - spaces around =
name = "Python"
age = 25
price = 19.99

# Bad - no spaces
name="Python"
age=25
price=19.99
```

## Examples

```python
# Well-formatted variable assignments
students_count = 1000
rating = 4.99
is_published = False
course_name = "Python Programming"
```

## Key Points

- **Descriptive names** make code self-documenting
- **Lowercase with underscores** follows Python conventions
- **Spaces around =** improves code readability
- Good variable names save time
